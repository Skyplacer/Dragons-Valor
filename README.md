Description: 

Dragonâ€™s Valor is an interactive narrative driven text-based adventure game developed for mobile 
devices. The story focuses on the player character as they embark on a quest to slay a dragon to 
save their kingdom. As the player embarks on their journey, they face a variety of scenarios where 
they are presented with three choices. The player can choose one choice for each scenario and the 
choice they make will determine the morality of their character.  
The game features a mechanism known as the morality value and it will either increase, decrease or 
remain the same based on the choice the player makes at each scenario. This morality meter will

the neutral ending.
